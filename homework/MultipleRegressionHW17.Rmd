# Introduction

Multiple regression analysis is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. This analysis is particularly useful in journalism for exploring complex relationships in civic data, such as how different demographic and socioeconomic factors collectively impact voter turnout. By understanding these relationships, journalists can provide deeper insights into civic participation patterns and identify potential barriers to voting.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages('corrplot')
library(corrplot)
```

## Load the Data

The first step in our analysis is to load the data. Here we read the data from a CSV file, which contains information about voter turnout and various demographic factors across Maryland counties. This dataset will be used to build our model that will try to see which factors are most important in predicting voter turnout. The turnout percentage is from the 2024 general election.

```{r}
md_turnout <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_turnout.csv")
head(md_turnout)
```

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (5 points)

Before building our model, let's explore the data to understand the variables and their relationships. Examine the correlation matrix to see how the independent variables relate to each other and to the dependent variable (voter turnout). Which variables seem to be correlated? Are there any that are not correlated at all? Also look at the multiple scatterplots. Which variables seem to have a linear relationship with the dependent variable? Which do not?

Voter turnout seems to be most closely correlated with employment status and racial demographics (percentage of the population that is white). There's a positive relationship between turnout and percentage of population that's white, while there's a negative relationship between turnout and unemployment rate. All six variables appear to have at least some correlation with voter turnout. The most linear relationship of all the variables appears to be unemployment rate, while population and percentage of white population are more clustered.

```{r}
# Summary statistics
summary(md_turnout)

# Create correlation matrix
selected_vars <- md_turnout |> 
  select(turnout, population, income, pct_bachelors_higher, 
         pct_unemployed, median_age, pct_white)
correlation_matrix <- cor(selected_vars)
print(correlation_matrix)

# Visualize correlation matrix
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "circle")

# Create scatterplots
md_turnout |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c(population, income, pct_bachelors_higher, 
                       pct_unemployed, median_age, pct_white),
               names_to = "variable", 
               values_to = "value") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = turnout)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Relationship between predictors and voter turnout",
       y = "Voter turnout (%)")
```

## Task 2: Initial Model Evaluation (5 points)

Next, we construct an initial linear model to analyze how different factors influence voter turnout across Maryland counties. This model helps us quantify the relationships and assess which factors are significant predictors of turnout. 

### Residuals

The residuals of a model are the differences between observed values and the values predicted by the model. For this model:

* **Min and Max** values indicate the range of residuals. 
* **Median** value tells us if the model is generally centered around the actual data points.

### Coefficients

The coefficients tell us the estimated effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable:

* **Population**: Is the coefficient positive or negative? Is it statistically significant?
* **Income**: Does higher income correlate with higher turnout?
* **Education (pct_bachelors_higher)**: How does education level impact voter participation?
* **Unemployment**: Is there a relationship between unemployment and voter turnout?
* **Median Age**: Do counties with older populations have different turnout rates?
* **Race (pct_white)**: Is there a relationship between racial composition and turnout?

### Model Fit

* **Residual Standard Error**: How much does the model typically deviate from actual turnout?
* **Multiple R-squared**: What percentage of the variability in turnout is explained by the model?
* **Adjusted R-squared**: How well does the model fit after accounting for the number of variables?
* **F-statistic**: Is the model as a whole statistically significant?


Examine the output of the model, checking the coefficients, residuals, and overall model fit. How well does this multiple variable model predict turnout? Do any of the variables seem to be insignificant? Is this a useful model, based on what you've seen? Why?

The residuals and p-value yielded by this model are quite low, while the adjusted R-squared value is at around 80%, indicating that this model predicts voter turnout quite accurately and should be considered. The population and income coefficients are small, suggesting those factors are insignificant. Otherwise, the four variables and other features of this model are useful because this data can contribute to an analysis of voter turnouts across counties.

```{r}
# Build initial model with all predictors
initial_model <- lm(turnout ~ population + income + pct_bachelors_higher + 
                   pct_unemployed + median_age + pct_white, data = md_turnout)
summary(initial_model)

```

## Task 3: Model Refinement (5 points)

Create three alternative models by adding or removing variables to see if we can improve the model's performance. Turnout will always be the dependent variable, but you should alter the independent variables by removing or adding some. Then compare the models using adjusted R-squared values. Are any of the models significantly better than the others?

I removed population as a dependent variable from Model 2, which produced a model with a slightly higher adjusted R-squared value than the original, full model. When I removed population and income in Model 3, then population, income, and median age in Model 4, the adjusted R-squared values decreased.

```{r}
# Model 2
model2 <- lm(turnout ~ pct_bachelors_higher + income + pct_unemployed + median_age + pct_white, data = md_turnout)
summary(model2)

# Model 3
model3 <- lm(turnout ~ pct_bachelors_higher + pct_unemployed + median_age + pct_white, data = md_turnout)
summary(model3)

# Model 4
model4 <- lm(turnout ~ pct_bachelors_higher + pct_unemployed + pct_white, data = md_turnout)
summary(model4)

# Compare models
cat("Model 1 (Full model) - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(initial_model)$adj.r.squared, "\n")
cat("Model 2 - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(model2)$adj.r.squared, "\n")
cat("Model 3 - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(model3)$adj.r.squared, "\n")
cat("Model 4 - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(model4)$adj.r.squared, "\n")

# Create comparison chart
model_names <- c("Full model", "Model 2", "Model 3", "Model 4")
adj_r_squared <- c(summary(initial_model)$adj.r.squared,
                   summary(model2)$adj.r.squared,
                   summary(model3)$adj.r.squared,
                   summary(model4)$adj.r.squared)

model_comparison <- data.frame(Model = model_names, Adjusted_R_squared = adj_r_squared)
ggplot(model_comparison, aes(x = reorder(Model, Adjusted_R_squared), y = Adjusted_R_squared)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Model Comparison by Adjusted R-squared",
       x = "Model")
```


## Task 4: Using the Model (3 points)

Without using the words "multiple regression model", describe how you could use this analysis to cover an election or voter participation story.

I would use these findings to analyze and explain the disparity in voter turnout across Maryland counties. For example, Prince George's County had the second-lowest voter turnout and has the highest unemployment rate of any Maryland county. I would discuss statistics such as this to inform readers of the correlation between certain demographics and voter turnout, and potentially discuss underlying issues that lead to these disparities.
